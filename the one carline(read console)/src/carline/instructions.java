/*
print 300 barcodes but only assign car rider families to barcodes
	
for students that ride with other families, say last name rider and last name seals:
seals and rider are different barcodes initially. if rider and seals ride together, add rider to seals and seals to rider
then both the barcodes will pull up the same names

arrange alphabetically by last name

have an extra "open" barcode which just means a barcode hasnt been assigned; override the repeated scan for this
upon scanning the barcode, the inside projector will just ask someone from the gym to meet the person standing outside to figure out what child is being picked up
